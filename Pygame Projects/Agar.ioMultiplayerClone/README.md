I've tried my best to make an agario clone. I was going to also add a chat, but it didn't work for some reason. Some potential improvements may be to make the player movement towards the mouse rather than WASD. But it still should be a functional game. If there are errors relating to the port being taken, simply change the variable 'port' in BOTH the client and the server code to any number between 1000-50000. For best results, choose either port 5050 or a port with 5 digits (it may reduce the amount of port taken errors).
