# DoodleRecogniser
If you draw a smiley, water glass, bike or umbrella, the AI will tell you which one it is.
It's not as good as I would have liked (it messes up if you draw it quite small) but then again, it's only being trained on 5 images. If you got some friends to draw some more images for you, then the accuracy would be a lot higher given that a lot more variety is being accounted for.
